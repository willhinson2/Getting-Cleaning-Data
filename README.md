# Getting-Cleaning-Data

This project has three additional files other than this README: codebook.md, run_analysis.R & tidydata.txt 

run_analysis.R accomplishes the tasks set forth in the assignment by 
Downloading the Data
Unzipping the Data
Assigning Variables for the Testing/Training Data
Merging the X, Y, & Sub Datasets 
Removing the Data that is outside the scope of the desired output 
Renaming the Activities for the Variables
Relabeling the Dataset with Descriptive Names
Creating a Tidy Dataset with the mean values for each variable

tidydata.txt is the resulting txt file created by the run_analysis.R code. 

codebook.md provides context to the run_analysis.R code and will show the variables assigned from the code.
